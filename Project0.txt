*/  First step: wcat program. 
    Goal of program: reads a file as specified by the user
    and prints its contents.
    Therefore, there must be a file input, the file must be opened by the
    program, it must get each line/character of the document, print the line,
    go to the next line, and print until there are no lines left.
    The output of the program should be a string. /*

   
    int main() {
        //wcat program 
        
        int wcat(String input) {
        char line[INT_MAX];
        
        FILE *fp = fopen("input", "r"); 
        if(*fp == NULL) {
            printf("file open failed\n");
            exit(1);
        }
        
        fgets(line, INT_MAX, *fp);
        printf(%s, line);
        }
    }
