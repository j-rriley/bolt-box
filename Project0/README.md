wcat : 
Wcat is a program I completed on 1/22/2020 that reads in a file, or multiple files, and prints each line. 

wgrep : 
Wgrep is a program I completed on 1/25/2020 that reads in a search term and a file (or more), and prints out a line of the file if it contains the search term.

wzip :
Wzip is a program I completed on 1/28/2020 that takes in a file, or multiple files, and compresses its contents. It takes the number of characters present and changes it into the ASCII character code that corresponds. With my file, I was able to get the first test output correct, but it did not give me a pass. Therefore, I had to manually run the other tests. I was able to get the same results as most of them excluding the multiple file input. 

wzip-beta :
The beta version of the above program is a bunch of code that I took about 4 hours on trying to debug and figure out my errors. I wanted to submit this as well because if we are able to see examples of code that passed each of the tests, I'd like to be able to reference this file as well. 

wunzip : 
Wunzip is a program I completed on 1/28/2020 that takes in a file, or multiple files, and decompresses them based off the compression in wzip. Because I wasn't able to fully pass wzip, it was hard for me to complete this file. Currently, it does not run properly because I am lost on how to properly parse through the input to ensure you are getting each 4byte integer and character.
